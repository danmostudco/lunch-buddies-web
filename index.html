        <h2>What is lunch buddies?</h2>
        <p>
            This app helps build relationships between members of a growing team. Each week, users will have the opportunity to join a small group of teammates for lunch. The <code>@lunch_buddies_bot</code> takes care of all the logistics.
        </p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <h3>Installation</h3>
        <p>Install the app using the button at the top of this page, or from the <a href="https://slack.com/apps/A8Z9J2Z1S-lunch-buddies">Slack App Directory</a>.</p>
        <h3>Basic Usage</h2>
        <h4>Step 1: Invite your teammates to the "#lunch_buddies" channel</h4>
        <p>
            The app works by polling the members of a Slack channel to see who is interested in participating.
            When you installed the app, a default "#lunch_buddies" channel was created. You should invite your teammates to this channel.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2: Create the poll</h4>
        <p>
            To initiate the process, type the following message in the #lunch_buddies channel.
            <br /><img source="/img/create_1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Advanced Options</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can customize both the times of the poll and the size of the groups. Here are a few examples:
            <br /><img source="/img/create_2.png" />
            <br /><img source="/img/create_3.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3: Respond to the poll</h4>
        <p>
            After receiving the <code>create</code> command, the bot will individually poll the members of the channel asking about participation.
            <br /><img source="/img/poll.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants can select their time preference or opt out.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 4: Close the poll</h4>
        <p>Navigate back to the "#lunch_buddies" channel and type the following message:
            <br /><img source="/img/close.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            The bot will randomly group people and start a group chat between all of them.
            <br /><img source="/img/group.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Advanced Usage</h3>
        <p>
            It is possible to have multiple polls going at the same time; they are uniquely defined by the channel from which they were created.
            For example, you could "create" a poll in the #seattle_office channel and also in the #san_francisco_office channel. Members of each channel will be independently polled and grouped.
        </p>
        <h2 id="privacy">Privacy policy</h2>
        <p>
            This app will create a channel called "lunch-buddies" and will poll each member of that channel whenever the "/lunch_buddies_create" command is run. When the "/lunch_buddies_close" command is run, it will start a private group message with each group. The only information saved is the answers to the interactive question about participating.
        </p>
