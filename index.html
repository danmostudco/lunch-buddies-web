        <a href="https://ahlfhssbq3.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/production/api/v0/install"><img alt="Add to Slack" height="40" width="139" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcset="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x" /></a>
        <h2>What is lunch buddies?</h2>
        <p>
            This app helps build relationships between members of a growing team. Each week, users will have the opportunity to join a small group of teammates for lunch. The @lunch_buddies_bot takes care of all the logistics.
        </p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
            To initiate the process, invite @lunch_buddies_bot to a channel and say "@lunch_buddies_bot create". This will send a message to each member of the current channel asking if they want to participate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The default possible answers are: "Yes (12:00)", and "No". You may also specify a set of custom times. For example, "@lunch_buddies_bot create 1145, 1230" will create a poll whose possible answers are "Yes (11:45)", "Yes (12:30)" and "No". You do not need to explicitly set "no" as an option; it is included by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may also use the "/lunch_buddies_create" command. This slash command can be invoked from anywhere in slack and it will poll the members of the "#lunch_buddies" channel. This is the "legacy" way of creating a poll.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once everyone has answered, you should go back to the same channel from which the poll was created and write "@lunch_buddies_bot close". This will randomly group the responders by their answer and start a private group message for each group. For example, if 60 people said "Yes (11:45)" and 30 people said "Yes (12:30)", @lunch_buddies_bot will create 10 random groups for the 11:45 time and 5 random groups for the 12:30 time.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you created the poll with the slack command "/lunch_buddies_create", you should close it with the slash command "/lunch_buddies_close".
        </p>
        <p>
            It is possible to have multiple polls going at the same time; they are uniquely defined by the channel from which they were created. For example, you can go to the #seattle_office channel and say "@lunch_buddies_bot create", and then go right to the #san_francisco_office channel and say "@lunch_buddies_bot create". Members of each channel will be independently polled and grouped.
        </p>
        <h2 id="privacy">Privacy policy</h2>
        <p>
            This app will create a channel called "lunch-buddies" and will poll each member of that channel whenever the "/lunch_buddies_create" command is run. When the "/lunch_buddies_close" command is run, it will start a private group message with each group. The only information saved is the answers to the interactive question about participating.
        </p>
